    <h2>Our pledge</h2>

    <p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as organizers pledge to making participation in our event as awesome as we possibly can. It is the policy of hax-camp to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideology.</p> 

    <p>Discriminatory conduct and harassment will not be tolerated at our event.</p> 

    <h2>Our standards</h2>

    <h3>How you will keep our community awesome:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Showing empathy to everyone</li>
        <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
        <li>Accepting constructive criticism</li>
        <li>Acting in the best interests of the community</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Behaviors our community will not tolerate:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Harassment - public or private</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
        <li>Trolling - derogatory interactions and personal or political attacks</li>
        <li>Doxing - publishing others' private information without permission</li>
        <li>Any conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in professional settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our responsibilities</h2>

    <p>Event organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Organizers have the right to remove or modify comments, commits, code, documentation, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an official representative at an event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

    <p>The hax-camp Code of Conduct applies to anyone involved in the event, including event organizers.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement</h2>

    <p>Instances of behavior which violates the hax-camp Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting project leadership at <a href="mailto:bto108@psu.edu">bto108@psu.edu</a> . The event leadership will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate. The event leadership is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

    <p>The hax-camp Code of Conduct was originally produced in the United States of America and operates based on US legal norms which presumes innocence until guilt is proven.</p>
