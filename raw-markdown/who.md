## Mark Milutinovic
**Cybersecurity Professional**

##### How did you become interested in web development?

> *“Back when I was a student at Penn State I worked on the ELMS Platform right as web components were first adopted. When I began working at my first job out of school, I transitioned into more cybersecurity work. Even though I’m a full time cybersecurity professional, I’m looking to get back into open source development, testing, and working in that space.”*

##### What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?

> *“If I can understand more of what things might be able to be compromised within a web component, then I can use that knowledge in the penetration tests that I execute when a client uses that technology. HAXCamp is a great way to stay up to date with what is out there and what people are actually building.”*

## Becca Goodman
**Web and Compliance Lead,** U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

##### How did you become interested in web development?

> *"I took a class during my senior year in college after I decided that I wasn’t going to continue on for a PhD in physics and I knew that I wouldn’t achieve my dream of becoming an award winning novelist overnight — I had to make myself more marketable. After the class and graduation, I got an unpaid internship at a web design firm and the rest is history. I have been working my way up and through ever since."*

##### What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?

> *I always enjoy the networking aspects as well as a chance to discuss emerging tech and anything people might be developing that could help make the user experience better for the end user of government websites."*

## Sonya Woods
**Lead Accessibility Consultant,** Penn State World Campus

##### How did you become interested in web development?

> *"I started at the Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences as a Technical Proofreader, using Drupal to deliver content digitally. As I continued in my career I began to become more interested in accessible practice, particularly when it comes to online content. Now, as I work on projects for World Campus, I not only want to tell developers the areas of the site that need to be fixed, but also give them a technical recommendation of how to do that. I've learned HTML and CSS along the way, and now I'm exploring JavaScript."*

##### What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?

> *"I'm hoping to learn more about web components and how to apply accessability to them. I've become interested in web components because they enable people to bake in accessible practice right into their websites. It's amazing that you can make changes in one place and have them show up everywhere."*
