<p><strong>Cybersecurity Professional</strong></p>
<h5>How did you become interested in web development?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Back when I was a student at Penn State I worked on the ELMS Platform right as web components were first adopted. When I began working at my first job out of school, I transitioned into more cybersecurity work. Even though I’m a full time cybersecurity professional, I’m looking to get back into open source development, testing, and working in that space.”</em></p>

<h5>What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If I can understand more of what things might be able to be compromised within a web component, then I can use that knowledge in the penetration tests that I execute when a client uses that technology. HAXCamp is a great way to stay up to date with what is out there and what people are actually building.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Web and Compliance Lead,</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</p>
<h5>How did you become interested in web development?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I took a class during my senior year in college after I decided that I wasn’t going to continue on for a PhD in physics and I knew that I wouldn’t achieve my dream of becoming an award winning novelist overnight — I had to make myself more marketable. After the class and graduation, I got an unpaid internship at a web design firm and the rest is history. I have been working my way up and through ever since.&quot;</em></p>

<h5>What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I always enjoy the networking aspects as well as a chance to discuss emerging tech and anything people might be developing that could help make the user experience better for the end user of government websites.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>Michael Potter</h2>
<p><strong>Principal Front End Developer,</strong> Red Hat</p>
<h5>How did you become interested in web development?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;After graduating with a political science degree, I wound up working at a place that had a few Drupal sites. Their web guy was leaving, so I learned as much as I could from him in the two weeks before he left. That led me to learn HTML, CSS on the front end side and later backend development development to develop my own Drupal modules. It was off to the races from there- I fell in love with coding a web development.&quot;</em></p>

<h5>What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I'm looking to see what patterns people are using to solve similar problems to what I'm working on. You can get so creative with web components- they're a fundamental building block and there's so many creative ways that you can use them to build many different things! When you see the way that other people are using web components it totally changes the way that you think about using them.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>Sonya Woods</h2>
<p><strong>Lead Accessibility Consultant,</strong> Penn State World Campus</p>
<h5>How did you become interested in web development?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I started at the Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences as a Technical Proofreader, using Drupal to deliver content digitally. As I continued in my career I began to become more interested in accessible practice, particularly when it comes to online content. Now, as I work on projects for World Campus, I not only want to tell developers the areas of the site that need to be fixed, but also give them a technical recommendation of how to do that. I've learned HTML and CSS along the way, and now I'm exploring JavaScript.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5>What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I'm hoping to learn more about web components and how to apply accessability to them. I've become interested in web components because they enable people to bake in accessible practice right into their websites. It's amazing that you can make changes in one place and have them show up everywhere.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>Andy Donato</h2>
<p><strong>Associate Software Developer</strong>, Neudesic</p>
<h5>How did you become interested in web development?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I broke into web development through my experience in college with THON. I worked as a developer and eventual product manager Dash, one of THON's logistics management applications that powers THON Weekend operations. Later into my THON experience, I got to interact with other web technologies, like the content management system WordPress. In my day-to-day on the job, I write a ton of React and work extensively with NextJS, its more opinionated over-achieving cousin. Getting involved with web development felt like drinking from a firehose at first - coming from a background of purely console applications running in a single file, the vast ecosystem of web development felt like a faraway land. Over time, I began to see the forest through the trees so to speak and recognize the underlying patterns common across languages and frameworks. Now I get to do it for a living!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5>What are you hoping to learn at HAXCamp?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I am looking forward to returning to my alma mater to meet similar-minded individuals who are interested in the web development space. I am also looking forward to learning about Web Components - I have yet to come across this technology in my day-to-day work, so I'm hoping to learn enough to possibly bring it back into my team at Neudesic.&quot;</em></p>
